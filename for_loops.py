# A very simple code exercise to iterate through the characters of a string \
# and print them out

parrot = "Norwegian Blue"

for char in parrot:
    print(char)
    print("Oh yeah!")

# Pay attention to what loops things are in because it will change the output
print()
for char in parrot:
    print(char)
