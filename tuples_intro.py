# An experiment with tuples

# When defining a tuple, enclose the values in round brackets to make it /
# obvious that it is a tuple.

t = ("a", "b", "c",)

# The output looks like a list output, but it is enclosed in round brackets /
# which shows that it is a tuple.

print(t)

name = "Michael"
age = 35

print(name, age, "Python", 2024)
print((name, age, "Python", 2024))
